# Enhancing Audio Description
## Overview
A new website to replace the old one: http://enhancingaudiodescription.com/

## TODO
- would be good to have all as posts and understand how to filter them for separate pages
- how could I remove the Gallery in the footer for some pages/posts?
- how come site folder is not seen in GitHub Desktop?
- how to add logo and title next to each other in menu?
- what is our MailChimp identifier?
- how to add more authors?
- what's the benefit of using the video iframe code coming with the theme over the iframe accessed on YouTube?
- resize headings e.g. h2 and h3 don't look very different
- tag filter on home pages should not have images in the back, how?
