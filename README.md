# Enhancing Audio Description
## Overview
A new website to replace the old one: http://enhancingaudiodescription.com/

## TODO
### now
- waiting for Mariana for final feedback
- work on new logo

## after switch
- add Google Analytics
- Medium article: what I've learnt when moving the EAD website from Wordpress to GitHub Pages?

## check accessibility 
-  https://platform.elevin.cloud/
-  https://www.experte.com/accessibility
-  two things in Warren's email


## send to Mariana
- list of urls where podcast/videos need transcribing or subtitles
- didn't add "To engage with our project on Twitter please use #EnhancingAD and @Mariana_J_Lopez." to Contact page again as it is in the footer.
- please let me know when Shelf Life is captioned and can be embedded
- added Elfed Howells' and John Whiston' name to the Contact page next to Lewis' and Morgan's
- can't see any monitisation or notification on credit issues with the Audio Game Review video on YouTube (https://youtu.be/bOJu8zfXytc)
- ask Mariana: LÃ³pez, M. , BBC Sounds Amazing: Celebrating Innovation in Audio. 15th October 2020 [There is a video for this and I can ask for permission to use it, but it would have to be captioned as well]
- which one is this? https://dtg.org.uk/webcast/lets-talk-innovation-with-dr-mariana-lopez/
- quotes from AP (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMHDEZ-I1-CyG3JxN9FuZTRydVWMDjLRf2MCM8wpttg/edit) - where to add?
  
### Home
- more integrated mailing list signup form (without new page opening up)

### Output
#### publications
- ! add publications (journals and maybe conferences as well - gradually as there are many) as new posts (individual files) with links to the Output page

#### podcasts
- add an audio symbol to the feature images in the post grid where the podcast has a media file e.g. podcast or video - but not to the image, instead, in a similar way to how the data is added to the tiles (so that it is not seen on the feature image added on the top of the post)

### general
- add tag filter to footer where tags link to the tag page (to specific headings)
- how to add more authors? (so I can display the author with an avatar for specific posts e.g. Mariana wrote some and Morgan as well. And this way we could have many authors e.g. contributions with more appropriate credits)
- provide captions for videos and audio?
- how can I design a feature image that can be used as an OpenGraph for Facebook/Twitter, etc? - do I need to?
- shall I add meta to each page/post separately to aid SEO?
- how come site folder is not seen in GitHub Desktop?
- maybe remove the dates from the post tiles and add the date from the front-matter to the article.html (with new CSS)
- check Shelf Life link in Kling Gut
- random gallery after new page is loaded e.g. something dynamic

## log
- 2022-01-12 search.json changed to be consistent with article.html function, access checked with online tools and then link sent to Warren
- 2022-01-11 new suggestions and content from M added
- 2022-01-08 sent summery video to M
- 2022-01-07 smaller team photos, smaller fixes for access, emma and lisa added to a.panel
- 2022-01-06 main MailChimp integration fixed, however would be good to have a better UX
- 2022-01-03 mailchimp identifier added (needs testing).  waiting for Elevin support to access dashboard (to test accessibility)
- 2021-21-28 higher score with https://www.experte.com/accessibility
- 2021-12-28 code changes
- 2021-12-10 pagignator has blog heading anchor, more outputs organised, minor feature image fixes
- 2021-12-08 organising data in a new way using the 'Output' page
- 2021-12-05 ported all posts, changed some of the default code e.g. to have one column head in posts, experimented with sharing on social media, etc. 
- 2021-11-30 events and diary entries are posts - sometimes merged e.g. 
- 2021-11-26 got access to york assets folder (can use on external website).  added all events and sought better images. 
- 2021-11-25 teams page, redirect url, new subdomain for testing
- 2021-11-24 using hero.html for team page with additional support from details/summary html element.  having difficulties with external_url (redirect) without using a custom domain (it works on localhost and custom domain, now subdomain ead.khofstadter.com), but when publishing the site with the github url, the domain name (base url?) is added in front of the redirect url.  perhaps the idea is to always test in a subdomain (custom domain's subdomain).  menu rearranged with simply renaming them e.g. 1-home.md, 2-press.md, .. 
- 2021-11-23 exporting content from WordPress to Jekyll, most done for press and media page
- 2021-11-22 theme installed, minor changes made
