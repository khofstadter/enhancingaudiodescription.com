# Enhancing Audio Description
## Overview
A new website to replace the old one: http://enhancingaudiodescription.com/

## TODO
### now

### Home
- new logo
- integrate MailChimp 
  - add a line to why they should join our mailing list

### Team 
- add Morgan and Lewis with one short paragraph at the end of Team's page

### Output
#### publications
- keep publications as list - or shall they be added as posts with feature images? perhaps both, if there is a nice way of doing this - maybe user can choose? 

#### podcasts
- (maybe) add some sound image to the feature images where the podcast has a media file e.g. podcast or video
- readdress SoundCloud players - find minimal code and loose embedded image? 

### general
#### footer
- add tags that link to the tag page (to specific headings)
- add alt text to all images - how to add them to feature images?
- why is image loading slow on team page?
- why do I sometimes need to click on the share button to see an image for Twitter/Facebook?
- how to add more authors?

### later
- can we embed Shelf Life or Pearl?
- make mailing list subscription element narrower, more centred.
- change all to LÃ³pez
- how can I design a feature image that can be used as an OpenGraph for Facebook/Twitter, etc? - do I need to?
- shall I add meta to each page/post separately to aid SEO?
- interviews with conference presenters could maybe have a conference photo with their presentation and a link to the conference page and their paper?
- how come site folder is not seen in GitHub Desktop?
- maybe remove the dates from the post tiles and add the date from the front-matter to the article.html (with new CSS)
- check Shelf Life link in Kling Gut
- random gallery after new page is loaded e.g. something dynamic

## before switch
- export analytics (Google or other)
- what I've learnt when moving the EAD website from Wordpress to GitHub Pages?

## after switch

## log
- 2021-12-10 pagignator has blog heading anchor, more outputs organised, minor feature image fixes
- 2021-12-08 organising data in a new way using the 'Output' page
- 2021-12-05 ported all posts, changed some of the default code e.g. to have one column head in posts, experimented with sharing on social media, etc. 
- 2021-11-30 events and diary entries are posts - sometimes merged e.g. 
- 2021-11-26 got access to york assets folder (can use on external website).  added all events and sought better images. 
- 2021-11-25 teams page, redirect url, new subdomain for testing
- 2021-11-24 using hero.html for team page with additional support from details/summary html element.  having difficulties with external_url (redirect) without using a custom domain (it works on localhost and custom domain, now subdomain ead.khofstadter.com), but when publishing the site with the github url, the domain name (base url?) is added in front of the redirect url.  perhaps the idea is to always test in a subdomain (custom domain's subdomain).  menu rearranged with simply renaming them e.g. 1-home.md, 2-press.md, .. 
- 2021-11-23 exporting content from WordPress to Jekyll, most done for press and media page
- 2021-11-22 theme installed, minor changes made
