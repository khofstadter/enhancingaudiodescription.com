# Enhancing Audio Description
## Overview
A new website to replace the old one: http://enhancingaudiodescription.com/

## now
- add Liam's photos to conference page
- add Mariana's conference reflection post (as a separate post)
- add remaining blog posts
- remove images from images/gallery folder and choose images for the home page gallery from the main images folder instead (add more e.g. from TATE)

## TODO
- shall I add meta to each page/post separately to aid SOE?
- interviews with conference presenters could maybe have a conference photo with their presentation and a link to the conference page?
- add new Panel List - waiting for M
- readdress SoundCloud players - find minimal code and loose embedded image? 
- add small space above share icons (probably remove Pinterest)
- add Morgan and Lewis with one short paragraph at the end of Team's page
- rename images from 'feature-...' to 'date+post-name...'
- try posts to not have two column heads but image on top, description below
- maybe rename file names so that have 'actual' date to avoid confusion between front matter date
- why is image loading slow on team page?
- would be good to have all as posts and understand how to filter them for separate pages
- how could I remove the Gallery in the footer for some pages/posts?
- how come site folder is not seen in GitHub Desktop?
- how to add logo and title next to each other in menu?
- what is our MailChimp identifier?
- how to add more authors?
- what's the benefit of using the video iframe code coming with the theme over the iframe accessed on YouTube?
- resize headings e.g. h2 and h3 don't look very different
- tag filter on home pages should not have images in the back, how?
- maybe remove the dates from the post tiles and add the date from the front-matter to the article.html (with new CSS)
- check Shelf Life link in Kling Gut
- add alt text to feature images
- update publication, presentation list
- update bios/photos, press e.g.

## log
- 2021-11-30 events and diary entries are posts - sometimes merged e.g. 
- 2021-11-26 got access to york assets folder (can use on external website).  added all events and sought better images. 
- 2021-11-25 teams page, redirect url, new subdomain for testing
- 2021-11-24 using hero.html for team page with additional support from details/summary html element.  having difficulties with external_url (redirect) without using a custom domain (it works on localhost and custom domain, now subdomain ead.khofstadter.com), but when publishing the site with the github url, the domain name (base url?) is added in front of the redirect url.  perhaps the idea is to always test in a subdomain (custom domain's subdomain).  menu rearranged with simply renaming them e.g. 1-home.md, 2-press.md, .. 
- 2021-11-23 exporting content from WordPress to Jekyll, most done for press and media page
- 2021-11-22 theme installed, minor changes made
