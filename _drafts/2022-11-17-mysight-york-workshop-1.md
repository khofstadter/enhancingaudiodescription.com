On Tuesday the 7th of June, our EAD team and eight other university members attended a [MySight York](https://www.mysightyork.org/) Visually Impaired Awareness and Sighted Guiding Training. 

Our trainers were Community Involvement Officer Vicky Smith and Group Assistant Intern Jade Packering.

Since I had been working with Mariana and Gavin on the previous EAD project a few years ago, I had some insights on visual impairment.

The workshop was not only refreshing but also deepened my understanding of the subject matter with a detailed introduction to types of visual impairments, a typical day for a blind person and guide dog etiquette as well as on guiding inside and outside buildings. 

Vicky and Jade brought simulation glasses so they could better experience the difference in visual impairments.

For example, macular degeneration, which is common in older people, makes it difficult to read and recognize faces. The picture below shows how this condition worsens central vision.

Another condition that affects vision is diabetic retinopathy caused by diabetes. This condition makes it difficult to read or drive, as vision loss results in patches. See the image demonstration below.

The third condition the simulation glasses helped us experience is glaucoma. This condition damages the optic nerves inside the eye, causing loss of peripheral vision, shown in the image below.

Another type of condition is cataract, which results in blurred vision. See the image demonstration below.

<!-- We were warned that this experience could be upsetting. -->

Our last practical session in the afternoon involved sighted guiding, for which we teamed up with a partner. We were either blindfolded or wore one of the simulation glasses while our partner was ushering us around the room, through doors as well as down and up on stairs. 

It was a great day. Vicky and Jade put together a very well organized workshop that not only helped me learn something new about accessibility, but was also very fun and enjoyable! We also enjoyed great catering with vegan and vegetarian sandwiches and cakes all sustainably packaged.
