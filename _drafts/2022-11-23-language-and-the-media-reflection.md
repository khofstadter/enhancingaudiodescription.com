On 7 Nov 2022, Mariana delivered a pre-conference workshop and a few days later a poster presentation at the 14th International Conference and Exhibition on Languages and the Media in Berlin, Germany.

<!-- 1. general conference, aims -->[Languages & The Media](https://www.languages-media.com/conference_workshops_2022) is an international conference full of interesting people held every two years. It has been going on for 25 years and is one of Europe's most important audiovisual events. Its sessions and workshops look at the trends, innovations, and technologies that are changing the way audiovisual media is delivered around the world.

Mariana was invited to lead a workshop and present a poster.

<!-- 2. pre-conference workshop --> She led a half-day workshop before the conference with the title "Enhanced Audio Description: Making Movies Accessible to Everyone Through Sound Design" in which participants learnt about the ideas behind the EAD methods and how they relate to the fields of accessible filmmaking and integrated access. Participants were able to watch and talk about specific examples of EAD, and then in hands-on activities explore how they could use these methods to create outputs that are accessible.

<!-- 3. poster presentation --> A few days later, Mariana presented our poster titled "Enhanced Audio Description: towards conveyance of cinematography and picture editing through sound design". This poster reported on the current stage of one of our work packages in which Mariana interviewed post-production sound professionals and has used a specific analysis method to extract insights from the recorded conversations. 

The poster was designed with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an open-source Adobe Illustrator alternative, and made accessible with Acrobat Reader. Download the poster in PDF format [here](../assets/docs/papers/LopezHofstadterKearney2022EADTowardsConveyancePoster.pdf).
