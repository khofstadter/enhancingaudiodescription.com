<!--
#todo 
- change link from external to internal
- add poster here or in another post (e.g. with the access struggle)

brief: 
> Yes, please, a blog post on the conference would be great. Please don't use the insights email I sent as this is generally speaking confidential information. If there's something really generic then that's fine, but other reflections are just for us. If you could put something together and send it to me I can check it. I think we can attach the poster to the blog post as well.  I don't see why not. Thanks!
