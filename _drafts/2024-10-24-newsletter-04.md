## Hi there,

Welcome to our Enhancing Audio Description Newsletter, where we'll keep you updated on our latest events, podcast releases, and research progress.

## DARCI 2025 Conference News

We're thrilled to announce that we are now offering bursaries for presenters for our upcoming Conference on Disability, Accessibility, and Representation in the Creative Industries (DARCI) 2025. This conference will take place from Wednesday, September 10th, to Friday, September 12th 2025, at the School of Arts and Creative Technologies, University of York, UK.
​
There are two types of bursaries available and our bursaries scheme is intended to support students and researchers who are facing financial barriers and who are D/deaf or disabled, and/or residents in a geographical area underrepresented in the fields of disability and accessibility, including Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. There are a small number of bursaries available, with presenters who are eligible being able to choose from one of two types.

**Type 1: Registration Fee Bursary**   
​This bursary covers the cost of conference registration fees only.

**Type 2: Enhanced Support Bursary​**   
This bursary covers both the conference registration fee and travel expenses (to be agreed upon allocation of the bursary), including accommodation, for presenters who wish to attend in person. To support sustainable travel choices, we encourage applicants to consider rail travel options where possible. While we recognise that international travel may be necessary, our goal is to minimise carbon emissions and promote environmentally friendly practices. In cases where long-distance flights are required, we recommend online attendance as a more sustainable option.

We look forward to receiving applications for these bursaries and supporting presenters who will benefit from attending the conference. To apply for a bursary you will first need to make an abstract submission to the conference. Please submit your abstract through [this portal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTlNZ8WKnnRfPuok3HkO8Ri0zccDYPq09XrckcGhSke4BVdw/viewform). Once you’ve made your submission please apply to the bursary through [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPvgnIH97vHimQuD6AHg_fgpMyOogwYpDmj0BByq8qPjH8WQ/viewform).
​
Abstract submission deadline: 4th November 2024 5pm UK time.

Deadline to apply for a bursary: 18th November 5pm UK time.
