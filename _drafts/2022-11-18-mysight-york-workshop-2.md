Following MySight York's Visual Impairment Awareness Training on June 6th, it was our turn the following day to instruct some of its members on a topic related to our EAD project: *the use of sound for storytelling*.

Vicky from MySight York teamed me up with Jane Bateman, a skilled interviewer with in-depth understanding of crafting effective questions, so we could deliver a practical, hands-on workshop together.

The workshop was planned to take place in the theatre of our university's Theatre, Film, Television and Interactive Media department. 

Wednesday was a very busy day in this building because theatre students were also in charge of their final-year performances and exhibitions. This is where the fresh memories of our training on sighted guiding from the day before were so helpful.

After all of us had settled inside the theatre, Vicky run a brief icebreaker session to help everyone introduce themselves before outlining the agenda for the day. 

Jane and I prepared two sessions each.

In the first session, I outlined variations in types of podcasts and called attention to the audio material and techniques used. I demonstrated and commented on spontaneous and rehearsed conversations, uninterrupted and edited narratives, the relationship between sounds quality and the microphones used, post-production, how noise artefacts could aid storytelling, layering of soundtracks and jingles. The examples I used were from [Rebel Wisdom](https://youtu.be/vpLAcewRBSE), [Sound Exploder](https://songexploder.net/steve-reich), [Good in Theory](https://goodintheorypod.com/episodes/socraticfamilyvalues), [Trickster](https://tricksterpodcast.com/), [Murray Schafer](https://youtu.be/rOlxuXHWfHw) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015vcw). The BBC example was an interview with Mariana, which gave a brief summary of our project and featured a scene from a short film enhanced with the EAD methods (e.g. the I-voice, binaural audio and additional sound effects).

In the second and third session, Jane first introduced us to methods that can help us become good interviewers and then gave us time to practice what we’ve learnt in small groups. A key concept she emphasised was that interviewers need to learn to become good listener (‘super receivers’) by using open-ended questions starting with the words ‘what’, ‘when’, ‘which’, ‘will’ and ‘how’. She also discussed the importance of researching our subjects before the interviews so that we can ask informed questions and the creation of a hook at the very beginning of the interview to make sure our audiences carry on listening.
 
As it was a sunny day, we ate our lunches outside the building on a set of colourful sofas set up by student as part of their exhibitions. Thanks to Vicky, there was a good selection of food available for all dietary requirements.

The usage of portable microphones was covered in the session that followed lunch, with a particular emphasis on the Zoom H1n device. First, I played a brief sound walk recorded the day before in the building to help demonstrate the use of settings on this device, effective adjustment of signal-to-mic distance, noise handling, tripod use, reduction of plosives and wind noise using a windscreen, and gaining benefits of using a boom stick.

Then, after asking participants to divide into four groups, we gave each group a Zoom H1n and some accessories to experiment with. Groups were encouraged to either record a short interview, an interesting ambient sound with an introduction and an outro, a presentation from a prepared script or a sound walk.

We all returned to the theatre about an hour later to listen to each other's recordings. The one I also engaged with can be listened to with the web-audio player below.

It was a lovely day getting to know Jane and other wonderful folks at MySight York for our EAD team. I hope we can meet again!

P.s: I also visited the AudioLab where Gavin and Michael work, where they have shown me their mulitspeaker system using head-related transfer functions and their anechoic chamber.
