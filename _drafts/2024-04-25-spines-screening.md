The event will focus on how the Enhanced Audio Description (EAD) methods were applied to the film through a collaboration between accessibility and creative teams. The EAD methods are an alternative to Audio Description, in which sound design, audio spatialisation and first person narration are used to provide an accessible experience for visually impaired audiences.
