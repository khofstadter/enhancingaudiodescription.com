Iâ€™m Warren Wilson, 31 years old and work for the Royal National Institute of Blind people as a Community Connection Coordinator. I have been working in this role since November 2017. Prior to working with [RNIB](https://www.rnib.org.uk/), I worked with [Cam Sight](https://www.camsight.org.uk/) for four years. Cam Sight are a local charity supporting blind and partially sighted people across Cambridgeshire. I lost much of my sight in 2009 due to a rare genetic condition called Lebers Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Before losing much of my sight at the age of 19, my interest in film, TV and media had increased significantly due to studying film Studies and Media Studies at A-level.
