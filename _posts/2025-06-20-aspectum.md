This compelling short film introduces Nina Chesworth and Miles Northwood, who discuss their experiences of Charles Bonnet Syndrome. Integrating sound effects, audio spatialisation and first person descriptions provided by Nina and Miles, this version of the documentary is accessible for visually impaired audiences. The film's EAD was evaluated through a survey and a focus group with visually impaired audiences and the final version presented here incorporates the feedback received. 

Please note that this documentary includes mention of topics that some people might find sensitive, these are surrounding specific aspects of sight loss including the mention of accidents and medical conditions.

The soundtrack is best experienced over headphones!
