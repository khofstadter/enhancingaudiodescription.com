This compelling short film introduces the lives of Nina and Miles, two individuals who experience unique visual hallucinations due to their conditions. By integrating first-person narration provided by these contributors — one of the EAD method — we enhanced the film's accessible for visually impaired audiences, which was also demonstrated a recent focus group at the University of York.
