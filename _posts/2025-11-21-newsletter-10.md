## Hi there,

Welcome to our Enhancing Audio Description Newsletter, where we'll keep you updated on our latest events, podcast releases, and research progress.
​
## DARCI 2025 Conference News

Huge thanks to everyone who attended the DARCI Conference both in person and online. It was a pleasure to welcome you all to York and we hope you left feeling inspired and ready to take on new research and practice challenges and opportunities. We were so excited that we wrote a few blog posts about the event, which we hope are also useful for those of you who would have liked to attend but weren’t able to as they provide a good summary of activities as well as reflections on accessibility and representation. [Mariana wrote](darci-conference-reflection) a reflection highlighting key happenings, [Martha wrote](marthas-internship-experience) specifically about her experience joining the team for an internship, and [Eden wrote](edens-darci-rooms) about how they designed a sensory and a quiet room for neurodivergent attendees. The conference was then further discussed in a podcast episode in which Mariana interviewed Gavin, Krisztián, and Chaimae on the highlights of the event as well as the ins and outs of organising an event with accessibility and representation not just in its content but its ethos. You can listen to this interview or read its transcript [on our website](darci-23).

Mariana will be sharing the photos from the event as soon as possible.

## EAD on BBC iPlayer

Last year the EAD team collaborated with MediaActive Projects on the short film Follow the Dogs (Garrett 2024). The film with the EAD soundtrack is now featured on the BBC. This is a huge milestone for the project as it is the first time EAD is offered by the BBC. To watch Follow the Dogs with its EAD soundtrack please visit [the iPlayer website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002hj67/beacons-short-films-from-wales-series-5-audio-described-follow-the-dogs?seriesId=unsliced) (only available within the UK). We also encourage you to share the news on the film on social media. If you’d like to copy us in, you can find the social media accounts information at the bottom of this email. We recommend wearing headphones to listen to the film so that you can access the audio spatialisation that is key to all of the EAD work.

## EAD Promo and Demo Videos

We've produced two new videos. [A promotional video](promo-video) on our EAD methods, as a short introduction to the topic and [a demo reel](media) of the work we do and how it adapts to different types of productions. The demo reel is set up in an A/B format, so you can watch the 'original' clip first and then it's followed by the EAD version. Headphone listening is strongly recommended as the audio is in binaural and audio spatialisation is key to our accessibility methods.

A reminder that you can also access our previous EAD productions through our website, including [‘Visible Mending’](visible-mending-bafta) (Moore 2023) and [‘Aspectum’](aspectum) (Morris, Kilpatrick and Regan 2024). More of our productions coming soon!

## DARCI Podcast

Mariana interviewed [Mairi Taylor](darci-21), Executive Director at Birds of Paradise Theatre Company. In a separate episode, [Monika Zabrocka](darci-22) talked about creative audio description for children, neurodivergent inclusion, and the future of accessible storytelling.
