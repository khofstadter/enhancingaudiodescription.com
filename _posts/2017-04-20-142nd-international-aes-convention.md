*Abstract:*

Audio Description (AD) is a pre-recorded verbal commentary that is added to a film or television programme to make visual elements clearer to visually impaired audiences.  One of the disadvantages of AD is that the addition of a layer of verbal commentary means that elements from the original soundtrack are masked and valuable information on the film as well as part of the intended engagement is lost.  The Enhancing Audio Description proposes to use binaural audio to reduce the number of verbal descriptions used for accessibility, by using accurately placed sound elements to give audiences information on the position of characters and objects in space as well as information on cinematic elements such as high and low camera angles and shots.
