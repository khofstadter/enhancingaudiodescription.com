*Abstract:*

Throughout the years digital technologies have been used to improve the mode of delivery of Audio Description for film, television and live events. However, the notions behind its design have been mostly unchanged despite significant advancements in digital sound. AD guidelines have failed to acknowledge how advancements in digital audio could be game-changers in the process of conveying information as well as providing an entertaining experience to visually impaired audiences.

The ‘Enhancing Audio Description’ project led by Mariana Lopez and Gavin Kearney is the first to research how digital audio technologies can transform the design and implementation of AD for film, television, interactive media and live events and as a result, change the ways in which visually impaired audiences experience audio-visual presentations.

The presentation discussed how sound design can be integrated to AD processes through the use of additional audio recordings and surround sound rendering; all of which could reduce the number of descriptions needed. The use of surround sound is proposed to provide an accurate rendition of character and object positions in space, types of shot, camera movements, camera angles and depth of frame. The application of first person descriptions by the main characters will also be discussed.
