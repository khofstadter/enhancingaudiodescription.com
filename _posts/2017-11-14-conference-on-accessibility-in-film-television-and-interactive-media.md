> The number of visually impaired people in the UK is expected to rise to 4 million by 2020, while by 2050 it is estimated that there will be 15.6 million of people with hearing loss in the UK. Such statistics reflect the urgency in which film, television and interactive media industries need to reflect on the diversity of their audiences as well as measures to increase both accessibility as well as foster inclusivity.

<br>

The conference provided an interdisciplinary forum, integrating approaches from the arts, humanities, engineering and social sciences that study both traditional and innovative approaches to accessibility. We particularly welcomed submissions in the field of sound design, audio engineering and music technology. The panels on these themes were organised under the umbrella of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) North of England section.
