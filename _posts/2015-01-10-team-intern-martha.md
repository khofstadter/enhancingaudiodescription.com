          <p>My name is Martha and I have just finished my second year at the University of York, studying Sociology with Social Psychology. As part of my degree, I have explored a range of models of disability, which has provided me with a strong foundation for understanding the complex relationship between disability and social structures. This has developed my interest in how barriers are often created not by impairments themselves, but by systemic ableism. My academic work has helped me adopt a more critical lens, particularly around accessibility and how underrepresentation can negatively affect identity and belonging.
          <br><br>
          I have experience organising and managing large-scale events, as well as working in corporate administration. I bring this background to my role as a Conference Operations and Events Management Intern, where I support the preparation and delivery of the DARCI conference to ensure it runs smoothly and inclusively. While just starting out in my professional journey, Iâ€™m keen to continue working in project management, particularly in spaces that contribute to social causes.
