On 9th November, at King's Manor in York, Mariana will be joined by filmmakers Joseph Inman and Samantha Moore as they discuss the introduction of accessibility for visually impaired film audiences through sound design to their productions.

The panel will provide insights on their experiences working with EAD and the accessibility team. This is a great opportunity for those interested in new accessibility methods as well as those looking to work on making their own productions accessible.

Joseph Inman is a film director working in Cornwall. Part of the film collective Bear Behind You, he makes both fiction and documentaries, with a focus on community participation and coastal storytelling. Their last film, [Spines](https://watershed.co.uk/filmhub/updates/news/spines-a-case-study-in-working-with-neurodiverse-talent-and-crew/), was the first BFI Network-funded film to be written, directed, and star an autistic person.

Sam Moore is a UK-based, international award-winning animation director. She loves the joyfulness and eclectic nature of animation. No one ever finds animation intimidating, and yet it can convey complex ideas to a wide audience in an engaging way. Sam has worked on diverse subjects, from competitive sweet-pea growing to cutting-edge microbiology, archaeology, neuroscience, and her own experience of having twins. Her latest film, [Visible Mending](https://visiblemendingfilm.com) (2023), was commissioned by the BFI Short Form Fund, produced by Tilley Bancroft, and made through MediaActive Projects. It was shot at Second Home Studios in Birmingham and is proudly UK-midlands-based and all-female in key roles. She is Senior Tutor (Research) in Animation at the Royal College of Art, UK, and a visiting professor in animation at University College Volda, Norway.
