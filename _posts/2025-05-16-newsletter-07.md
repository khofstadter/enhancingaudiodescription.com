## DARCI Podcast and Blog Posts

Since our last newsletter, we’ve released two new DARCI podcast episodes.

In last month's episode, you can hear [Sarah McDonagh](/darci-16) talk about her work specialising in media accessibility, cultural heritage and sustainability. In this month’s episode you can listen to [Nwando Ebizie](darci-17), an unclassifiable polymath, British Nigerian multidisciplinary artist who creates afrofuturist speculative fictions and alternate realities at the intersection of live art, experimental music, and multisensory installations. Read the accompanying transcriptions on our website using the hyperlinks provided above or find these episodes on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1GXirNuAD2vLYMp0vcLBq1) or [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/darci/id1798513207). 

In addition to podcast episodes, we've published a new blog post. In the post titled [Attending ARSAD in Barcelona](/arsad-reflection), Chaimae reflects on her very first time at the ARSAD (Advanced Research Seminar on Audio Description) Conference in Barcelona, which took place from the 19th to the 21st of March 2025. [In another new blog post](/conveying-cinematography-through-sound), Kris updates us on his research study using sound to convey cinematographic elements.  

## Research News

We're excited to welcome [Mario Vallejo Reyes](/team-mario-alberto-vallejo-reyes) and [Patrick Cairns](/team-patrick-cains) to our team!

Mario is conducting listening tests to refine an intelligent renderer, focusing on reverb perception that can be used in EAD applications. His work aims to enhance audio immersion and accessibility. Patrick is developing automated mixing tools that can be used by EAD producers. He’s working on machine learning methods for tagging content and a VST plugin to streamline production.

Thanks!

[EAD team](/team)
