Born and bred in Leeds, Lisa’s first commission was an episode of Kay Mellor’s Fat Friends. She went on to join the Emmerdale writing team, before writing for New Tricks, winning the RTS Yorkshire Best Writer award for one of her episodes. 

She wrote extensively for Waterloo Road and on the final series of Robin Hood for the BBC. She moved on to write ITV’s perennial Midsomer Murders including the fan favourite “Death by Cheese” episode.  Recently she has written episodes of Ackley Bridge, Call the Midwife and All Creatures Great & Small. She was Lead Writer on the third series of A Discovery of Witches for Sky. 

She writes for theatre as part of the Leeds-based Unsung Collective and has written for Slung Low and Freedom Studios. Black Teeth & A Brilliant Smile, her play about Bradford writer Andrea Dunbar, will tour again in 2023. 

Lisa is currently the Chair of the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain.
