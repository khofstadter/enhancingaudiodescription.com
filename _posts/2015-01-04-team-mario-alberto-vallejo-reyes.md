          <p>Mario is an audio engineer and researcher with a background in studio production, music technology, and education. He holds a Master of Science in Audio and Music Technology from the University of York, where he is currently conducting empirical research on perceptual thresholds in reverberation as part of the Enhancing Audio Description II study, aimed at improving accessibility standards in film and television sound. He previously earned a Master’s in Educational Technology and a Bachelor’s in Audio Engineering, with further training in New York through Dubspot and SAE Institute.
          <br><br>Before joining the University of York, Mario worked as Chief Engineer at two professional studios in Mexico, contributing to one Latin Grammy-nominated project and productions streamed almost two billion times. He has also taught university-level courses in recording and mixing. His current research explores the perceptual limits of reverberation and digital emulations in audio processing.
