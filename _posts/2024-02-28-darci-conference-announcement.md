## Call for Papers

**Wednesday 10th September – Friday 12th September 2025**  

School of Arts and Creative Technologies, University of York, York, UK

The arts are central to human experiences. However, lack of access to creative and cultural experiences, and to creative practice marginalises disabled people, and limits their representation. Moreover, most work on accessibility still occurs outside of the creative and technical workflows involved in creative productions, limiting opportunities for transformative collaborations among creators, accessibility experts and disabled audiences. 

The Conference on Disability, Accessibility and Representation in the Creative Industries (DARCI) welcomes contributions that approach research and practice in the fields of disability, accessibility and representation from diverse perspectives. We welcome submissions from all areas of the creative industries, including theatre, film, television, music, gaming and interactive media more generally, as well as those linked to heritage and other cultural sites. 

The conference will take place from Wednesday 10th September to Friday 12th September. Wednesday will be dedicated to pre-conference workshops and other events, whereas Thursday and Friday will be full conference days with a variety of activities.

We are interested in research or industry paper presentations, posters, demos, panels, performances/installations and workshop proposals defined in the following ways:

- **Paper presentations** (15 minute presentation + 5 min Q/A). Well suited for presentations that have findings and outcomes to share. 
- **Lightning bolt presentations** (5 minute presentation + a poster session for discussions). Ideal for work in progress.
- **Panel discussion** (60 minutes) Panel proposals need to be submitted by the person chairing and organising them and should include an indication of the different panellists and the topic/s to be covered. Ideal for those wanting to engage in longer discussions on a topic and incorporate different perspectives. 
- **Demo/Performance session**: a non-traditional presentation that showcases approaches to accessibility and/or representation with a creative/technical piece. Length and presentation format will vary from piece to piece.
- **Pre-conference workshop** (180 minutes): a workshop tailored for a smaller number of people in which participants get to learn about a specific topic in a hands-on manner. All workshops will take place on Wednesday 10th September.

The topics may include, but are not limited to:

- Accessibility strategies in the creative industries, including Audio Description, Captioning, Signing, Accessible Controllers and any other accessibility strategies.
- Accessibility in different cultural contexts.
- Immersive experiences and Inclusion.
- Digital technologies and new methods for accessibility.
- Practical and theoretical aspects of implementing new technologies.
- Impact and importance of new technologies and methods to the field of accessibility.
- New technologies as an aid to social inclusion.
- Including end users and audiences in research and development projects.
- Storytelling through sound in the context of accessibility.
- Integrated access/accessible filmmaking.
- Representation of disability in the creative industries, including all roles in the creative industries.
- Intersectional representation of disability.
- Environmental Sustainability and Accessibility.
- Sensoriality in museums and their role in accessibility.

Submissions are through abstracts of no more than 300 words. The submission portal will be opening soon. 

DARCI is a hybrid conference with opportunities to present both in person in York and online. You will need to indicate your mode of attendance at the point of submission.

**Deadline for abstract submission**: Monday 4th November 2024 5pm GMT.

**Notification of outcome**: By end of February.

**Final version of abstract**: Friday 11th July 2025 5pm GMT.
