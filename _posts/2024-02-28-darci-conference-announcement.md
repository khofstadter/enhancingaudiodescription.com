Back in 2017 we had the pleasure of welcoming delegates from all over the world for our highly successful [conference](conference-on-accessibility-in-film-television-and-interactive-media) on Accessibility in Film, Television and Interactive Media, and we are now ready to welcome you all back. Similarly to our 2017 event we will be welcoming contributions that approach research and practice in the fields of disability, accessibility and representation from diverse perspectives and there will be different presentation formats available. We welcome submissions from all areas of the creative industries, including theatre, film, television, music and interactive media,  as well as those linked to heritage and other cultural sites.

Mark your calendars for 10th, 11th, and 12th September 2025. The three-day event will include a day of pre-conference workshops followed by two full days of conference papers, keynotes and others.

Stay tuned for more information! The call for papers will be announced in July. Until then, save the dates and get ready for an exciting conference!
