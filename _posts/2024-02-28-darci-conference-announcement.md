After the success of our [conference in 2017](conference-on-accessibility-in-film-television-and-interactive-media), we are excited to continue the tradition of integrating technical and creative approaches to disability, accessibility and representation.

Mark your calendars for 10th, 11th, and 12th September 2025. The conference will be held at the TFTI and Piazza buildings at the University of York. The three-day event will consist of one day of pre-conference workshops followed by two full days of conference papers.

Stay tuned for more information on early bird, standard fee, and student concessions fees. The call for papers will be announced in July. Until then, save the dates and get ready for an exciting conference!
