Mariana talks about the importance of her first academic job at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) with [Rob Toulson](https://www.robtoulson.com/), which was a significant stepping stone in her career, and the huge importance to her of Rob's mentorship, as well as [Damian Murphy](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/damian_murphy/)'s mentorship upon returning to York to work as a lecturer. Mariana also discusses her projects, including EAD and her new book “[Sonic Pasts](https://www.routledge.com/Sonic-Pasts-Acoustical-Heritage-and-Historical-Soundscapes/Lopez/p/book/9781032300054)”, focusing on the fields of acoustical heritage and historical soundscapes from an interdisciplinary perspective, with examples on how different cultures hear and perceive sound differently. On EAD, she discusses how sound design, sound spatialisation and first person description/narration are used to provide an alternative to traditional audio description (AD).

Towards the end of the interview, Mariana shares her thoughts on how to create more inclusive environments, such as having a diverse range of speakers at events and making an effort to represent different perspectives. She talks about the importance of work-life balance, citing her own experiences of burnout during her early career. She emphasises the need for researchers to prioritise their wellbeing and take breaks when needed. For women looking to break into the field, Mariana advises creating one's own networks rather than trying to fit in with existing patriarchal structures.
