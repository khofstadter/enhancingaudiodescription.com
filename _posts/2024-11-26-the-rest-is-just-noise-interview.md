Mariana talks about the importance of her first academic job at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) with [Rob Toulson](https://www.robtoulson.com/), which was a significant stepping stone in her career. She then talks about returning to York, where she worked with [Damien Murphy](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/damian_murphy/), who played a key role in supporting her as she became a Professor.

Mariana discusses her projects, including EAD and her new book "[Sonic Pasts](https://www.routledge.com/Sonic-Pasts-Acoustical-Heritage-and-Historical-Soundscapes/Lopez/p/book/9781032300054)" on acoustical heritage from an interdisciplinary perspective, with examples on how different cultures hear and perceive sound differently. 

Later Mariana also shares her thoughts on how to create a more inclusive environment, such as having a diverse range of speakers at events and making an effort to represent different perspectives. She talks about the importance of work-life balance, citing her own experiences of burnout during her early career. She emphasizes the need for researchers to prioritize their wellbeing and take breaks when needed. For young women looking to break into the field, Mariana advises creating one's own networks rather than trying to fit in with existing patriarchal structures. She also recommends surrounding oneself with supportive people who can offer guidance and encouragement.
