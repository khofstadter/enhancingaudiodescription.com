Mariana shares her thoughts on how to create a more inclusive environment, such as having a diverse range of speakers at events and making an effort to represent different perspectives. She also talks about the importance of work-life balance, citing her own experiences of burnout during her early career. She emphasizes the need for researchers to prioritize their wellbeing and take breaks when needed. For young women looking to break into the field, Mariana advises creating one's own networks rather than trying to fit in with existing patriarchal structures.
