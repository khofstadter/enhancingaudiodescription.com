title: EAD Demo Video
description: "A demonstration of the work we do and how it adapts to different types of productions. We have set it up in an A/B format, so you can watch the 'original' clip first and then it's followed by the EAD version. Our EAD work uses binaural audio, please listen over headphones to experience the audio spatialisation. Captions are available."
