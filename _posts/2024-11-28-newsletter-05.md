## Hi there,

Welcome to our Enhancing Audio Description Newsletter, where we'll keep you updated on our latest events, podcast releases, and research progress.

## DARCI 2025 Conference News

We're happy to share that since our last newsletter, we've been diligently preparing for our [upcoming DARCI conference in Sep 2025](darci-conference-announcement). The response has been overwhelming, with a significant number of abstracts submitted - we're excited to be reviewing them now!
​
## Events

As part of the [York Disability Week 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/iddpyork), we are proud to present ‘Enhanced Audio Description (EAD): sound design, integrated access and the future of accessibility’, a free hybrid event that explores innovative accessibility solutions for visually impaired audiences. Mariana and Gavin will present how EAD uses sound design, audio spatialisation, and first-person description integrated into film and television productions to provide an immersive experience, as an alternative to traditional Audio Description.

You can attend in-person or online via Zoom.

Our event is designed to be inclusive and accessible for all with:

- Option to attend in person or online
- BSL interpreter available
- Hearing loop for hearing assistance
- Step-free access and wheelchair-accessible restrooms
- Accessible parking options
- Zoom automated captions or equivalent for online attendees
- Before the presentation, we will provide refreshments and networking opportunities.

Date: Tuesday, December 3rd Time: 6:30pm - 8:15pm GMT

Location: School of Arts and Creative Technologies, Campus East, University of York. Baird Lane, York, YO10 5GB
