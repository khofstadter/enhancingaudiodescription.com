## DARCI Podcast and Blog Posts

In this month's DARCI episode, you can hear filmmakers [James Edward Kilpatrick and Jack Morris](darci-18) talk about their experiences of working with the EAD team to make their film 'Aspectum' accessible for visually impaired audiences, and about their perspectives on accessibility and hopes for the future.

In our new blog post titled [Conveying Cinematography Through Sound](conveying-cinematography-through-sound), Kris updates us on the work he's been doing as part of his research within the EAD team, where his focus has been on how to use sound to convey cinematographic elements.

Any questions, please feel free to email us on enhancingad@gmail.com. Social media updates on the project are added on Twitter/X @Mariana_J_Lopez on Bluesky @marianajlopez.bsky.social and on [Mariana’s LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-lopez-9a229096/).
