## Report Abstract 
This study aimed to identify potential actions which could improve the quality of audio description (AD) for documentaries broadcast on television. Feedback was collected from 68 AD users via a focus group, multiple interviews, and a distributed questionnaire. Participants were shown examples of real audio described documentaries and asked a variety of questions about their own experiences. Suggestions for improvement were abundant, but key points included ensuring an AD script is concise and relevant, the delivery style matches that of the documentary, and volume levels of the AD and programme audio are consistent and well-balanced.
