Throughout the day we engaged with the art pieces, had the pleasure of talking to the organisers, Andrew and Sarah and even managed to speak to artists, [Lynn Cox](https://www.artscoachingtraining.com/) and [Ian McNamara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-mcnamara-4b7b4465/) about their work as well as the research we are conducting as part of Enhancing Audio Description.

We are very grateful for the organisers’ support and attendees’ interest in our project.
