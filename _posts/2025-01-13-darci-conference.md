## Introduction

**Wednesday 10th September – Friday 12th September 2025**  

School of Arts and Creative Technologies, University of York, York, UK

The arts are central to human experiences. However, lack of access to creative and cultural experiences, and to creative practice marginalises disabled people, and limits their representation. Moreover, most work on accessibility still occurs outside of the creative and technical workflows involved in creative productions, limiting opportunities for transformative collaborations among creators, accessibility experts and disabled audiences. 

The Conference on Disability, Accessibility and Representation in the Creative Industries (DARCI) welcomed contributions that approach research and practice in the fields of disability, accessibility and representation from diverse perspectives. We received submissions from all areas of the creative industries, including theatre, film, television, music, gaming and interactive media more generally, as well as those linked to heritage and other cultural sites. We are currently reviewing the submissions and will notify authors by end of February.

The conference will take place from Wednesday 10th September to Friday 12th September. Wednesday will be dedicated to pre-conference workshops and other events, whereas Thursday and Friday will be full conference days with a variety of activities.

## Keynote Speakers

### Raymond Antrobus

Title: An Investigation of Missing Sound

Antrobus has described himself as an 'Investigator of Missing Sound', what does that mean to him and how might it apply to his, and potentially, our, writing lives?

Raymond Antrobus is the author of three poetry titles: The Perseverance (Penned in the Margins), All The Names Given (Picador) and Signs, Music (Picador). Antrobus’s poems have been added to GCSE syllabi, and his poetry has won the Ted Hughes Award, the Somerset Maugham Award and the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award. In 2019 he became the first ever poet to be awarded the Rathbone Folio Prize for best work of literature in any genre. He is also the author of two children’s picturebooks, including Can Bears Ski? (Walkers Books), which became the first story to be broadcast on the BBC entirely in British Sign Language. Antrobus is an advocate for several D/deaf charities, including Deaf Kidz International and the National Deaf Children’s Society. Antrobus was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2020 and appointed an MBE in 2021.

### Prof. Hannah Thompson 
Title: The Sensational Museum: Disability Gain and the Journey from Access to Inclusion

[The Sensational Museum](https://sensationalmuseum.org/) is a 27-month AHRC-funded research project which runs between April 2023 and July 2025. Underpinned by specialisms in design, digital heritage, disability studies, psychology, public history, and professional experience in the heritage sector, TSM rejects the ‘look and learn’ approach that has influenced both how museums construct and store collections information and how this information is communicated to audiences. 

In this plenary, project PI Professor Hannah Thompson will present the project’s key findings and argue that the project’s focus on ‘Disability Gain’ and the resulting progression from ‘access’ to ‘inclusion’ can offer a blueprint for the cultural sector more widely.
The project is grounded in action research and co-creation with industry professionals. We worked with a range of museums across the UK, to create environments where no one sense is necessary or sufficient for a fulfilling museum experience. Rather than providing additional accommodations for workers’ and visitors’ specific needs, we explore how institutions might embed inclusive designs and content into everything they do, meaning that every museum visitor and professional can trust that the museum will be accessible to them.

This sector-transforming multisensory challenge raises a critical question – how do we unpick millennia of ocularcentric bias whilst still maintaining visitor and practitioner trust? Our solution builds on the theory of ‘Disability Gain’, recognizing that disabled living, and adaptations developed for and by disabled people, can enhance the experiences of everyone. TSM aims to put disability at the centre of all aspects of practice – from collections management and curation to exhibition design and education – and use what we know about disability to change how everyone engages in a museum. 
Thompson will present the theoretical underpinnings behind the Sensational Museum project, before exploring some of the project’s outputs and discussing the impact on TSM lessons learnt  for the cultural sector more broadly.

Professor Hannah Thompson (Royal Holloway, University of London) is a partially blind academic and activist. Her research focuses on the intersections between Critical Disability Studies and French Studies and she has published 3 monographs and numerous papers on nineteenth-century French literature.  Hannah is currently working on creative audio description in museums, art galleries and theatres and her notion of ‘blindness gain’. She was Production Consultant for the Donmar Warehouse’s installation BLINDNESS in 2020 and worked with a range of theatres and audio describers during her AHRC 2021-2 EDI Fellowship ‘Inclusive Description for Equality and Access’. In April 2023 she became PI on a £1M AHRC-funded grant The Sensational Museum which aims to ‘use what we know about disability to change how museums work for everyone.’ Hannah writes about her place as a partially blind academic in a resolutely sighted world in her blog [Blind Spot](http://hannah-thompson.blogspot.com/).

## Pre-conference Workshops

### Joel Snyder
Title: Audio Description: If Your Eyes Could Speak

How can a blind person “see” a media event, a theatrical presentation, or a museum exhibit? This workshop will demonstrate how audio description (AD) provides access to the arts for people who are blind – and involve workshop participants in the creation of AD for short video excerpts. AD makes visual images accessible for people who are blind or have low vision via a translation of visual images to succinct language. Using words that are vivid and imaginative, describers observe, select, and use language to convey the visual image that is not fully accessible to a significant segment of the population. This interactive session will be largely based on my own professional audio description work over 44 years in the areas of performing arts (theater, dance, opera), media (film, video, DVDs, streaming services), and museums. All providers of audio description and those interested in studying AD should have adequate training in the fundamentals of audio description. In addition to an overview of the history of audio description and a focus on the nature of the audiences for audio description, the workshop to be presented is focused on “The Four Fundamentals of Audio Description” developed by Dr. Snyder throughout the 1990s:

- OBSERVATION: Active Seeing / Visual Literacy -- how to develop skills in concentration and observation
- EDITING: WHAT SHOULD BE DESCRIBED -- the art of ""editing"" from what you see
- LANGUAGE: WHAT WORDS TO USE – Brevity, Imagination, Objectivity
- VOCAL SKILLS: using the spoken word to make meaning"

Dr. Joel Snyder is known internationally as one of the world’s first “audio describers,” a pioneer in the field of Audio Description. Since 1981, he has introduced audio description techniques in over 40 states and 65 countries and has made thousands of live events, media projects and museums accessible.  In 2014, the American Council of the Blind published Dr. Snyder’s book, The Visual Made Verbal – A Comprehensive Training Manual and Guide to the History and Applications of Audio Description, is available as an audio book, in Braille, and in English, Polish, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and Chinese print editions. His PhD is from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona with a focus on audiovisual translation/audio description. Dr. Snyder is the President of Audio Description Associates, LLC and the Founding Director Emeritus of the Audio Description Project of the American Council of the Blind.

### Elizabeth Kuti
Title: Making Inclusive Audio Drama

This workshop will take participants through a series of practical exercises for writing audio drama parts for actors with learning disabilities, and neurodiversity of all kinds. Participants will discuss the ethics of ‘writing with’ and ‘writing for’ groups, and the dangers of ‘ventriloquizing’ the voices of LD people. They will examine how best to work collaboratively to provide a platform for the authentic portrayal and representation of learning disabled and neurodivergent people. They will also investigate inclusive rehearsal practices. Elizabeth will offer practical exercises and provocations drawing on my work at the University of Essex, with the BBC, with independent audio drama companies such as Pier Productions, and with the theatre company Separate Doors. Through the workshop Elizabeth will offer a practical exploration and discussion of her findings and her proposed best practice guidelines for audio drama producers who wish to 'normalize' the voices, stories and experiences of ND people in audio drama. I will discuss artistic and practical strategies for making inclusive audio drama and reaching both 'ND' and non-ND audiences, and invite further exploration of the issues, practical, ethical, artistic and political in being a non-learning disabled playwright or drama producer working with actors who have learning disabilities or other neurodivergencies. This will be an inclusive workshop and Elizabeth welcomes the presence of non-neurotypical participants. Delegates are encouraged to bring pen and paper.

Elizabeth is a playwright whose works include The Sugar Wife (Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 2024; Project Arts Dublin and Soho Theatre, 2005-6;); Fishskin Trousers (Finborough Theatre, 2014; Park Theatre, 2017); Treehouses (Abbey Theatre Dublin 2000); and for radio, Sea Longing (BBC Radio 3 2019). She was the Writer in Residence at Hampton Court Theatre from 2015-16 and wrote over fifty micro-plays for performance in the Palace over that period. She have won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, a Stewart Parker Award and the BBC Audio Drama award for Best Original Drama. Elizabeth is a Professor at the University of Essex where she has taught drama, playwriting and literature since 2004. Her audio drama Gret and Will starring Sarah Gordy MBE, an actor with Down’s Syndrome, was produced by Pier Productions and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2023. She has also worked with director Ness Brooks for Separate Doors Theatre Company writing drama for neurodivergent actors (Derby Playhouse and Chichester Theatre), and supervised the playwright Judith Johnson’s Ph.D. in writing plays with and for the inclusive theatre company Razed Roof. Making Inclusive Audio Drama is her account and analysis of best practice for playwrights and audio drama producers who want to make audio drama with neurodivergent actors.

### Michelle Duxbury
Title: Creative Audio Description Through an Exploration of the Landscape Beyond the Visual

Join disabled and neurodivergent artist Michelle Duxbury for an introduction to creative audio description through an exploration of the landscape beyond the visual. During the first part of the workshop, participants will spend some time exploring the outdoor space on campus, working with a series of prompts and provocations designed to centre a multi-sensory approach to engaging with the landscape. Participants will be encouraged to immerse themselves in the sounds and smells and feel of the landscape, documenting and recording their experiences using simple equipment such as their phones or notepads. In the second part of the workshop, participants will be invited to spend some time creating an audio description of the outdoor space they were exploring, again centering a multi-sensory approach and stepping away from a simple visual description. At the end of the session participants will be invited to share their audio descriptions with the group, if they are comfortable to do so. Alternatively Michelle is happy to share on their behalf.

Michelle Duxbury is an artist and postgraduate researcher from Leeds, with a studio practice based in Wakefield. Her work explores an intrinsic link between landscape, body and identity, and how our individual and collective (dis)connection to landscape can impact on our feelings of belonging/not belonging. She works with embroidery, moving image, sound and immersive installation work, using fictional narratives and speculative thinking to radically reimagine how disabled (and other marginalised) people might interact with landscapes they can not be physically present in, drawing on her own experiences as a disabled, neurodivergent woman from a working-class background.
