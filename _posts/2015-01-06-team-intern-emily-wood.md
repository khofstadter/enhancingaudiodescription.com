          <p>In 2022, Emily from Birmingham entered her final year of an MSci Psychology degree at the University of York, specialising in neuroscience and neuroimaging.

         As an EAD intern, in the summer of 2022, Emily worked with the Royal National Institute for the Blind, researching audio description for documentary television programs. She worked with blind and partially sighted individuals to learn about their experiences with audio-described documentary programs, establish the strengths and weaknesses of the audio description, and propose potential improvements.
