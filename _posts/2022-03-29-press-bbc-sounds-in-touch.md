Just wanted to share with you that Fern Lulham, who interviewed me for Digital Planet back in November, has also been disseminating the project on BBC Radio 4 on the In Touch programme.  She ran a very short interview with the host and inserted some of the sections of my interview with her and an extract from Pearl.  It's really good and I really like how she responded to the questions from the host.
