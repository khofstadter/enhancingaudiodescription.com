## Hi there,

Welcome to our Enhancing Audio Description Newsletter updating you with our events, podcast, and research progress.

## Events

Join us for a free screening of *Spines*, followed by a Q&A at Dolby’s Screening Room in London on June 8th. The version of the film screened has our EAD methods integrated to create a form of accessibility through sound design. The event will provide an opportunity to experience EAD and to learn more about this form of access from the perspectives of accessibility and filmmaking teams. The film is suitable for all ages but it is particularly aimed at children and young people. [Visit our website for more info](/neurodiverse-talent-and-crew).

Our symposium in Edinburgh on 18th May was a success! You can read a reflection on the event in the blog post titled [Removing Barriers: Symposium on Disability and Accessibility in the Creative Sector](/symposium-reflection).

Save the dates for our [DARCI Conference 2025](/darci-conference-announcement-cfp) on September 10th, 11th, and 12th. The Call for Papers will be released in early July.

## DARCI Podcast

Since our last newsletter, we have published two new episodes. The first one features Maria Oshodi, founder of Britain’s leading performing arts company of visually impaired artists, Extant. In the episode, Maria shares her insights on the field, her work with Extant, her collaborations with other artists, and her freelancing on a number of independent arts projects. The second episode is an interview with Amelia Cavallo, a blind, USA-born theatre practitioner, academic, and workshop facilitator who works as a multidisciplinary performer, musical director, lecturer, and consultant on access and audio description. You can access all the podcast episodes directly through [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1GXirNuAD2vLYMp0vcLBq1) and [Acast](https://shows.acast.com/65942920c316a8001764d0b4), or you can also find the blog posts for these episodes on our website, with transcriptions, using the following hyperlinks:

- [​DARCI Episode 05​](/darci-05)

Upcoming episodes will feature Dr Kulnaree Sueroj, who discusses Audio Description in Thailand and Dr Samantha Moore, director of the BAFTA nominated short film [*Visible Mending*](/visible-mending-bafta), who reflects on the process of incorporating EAD to her film.

## Research News

An important aspect of our project is working with professional film and television productions. In addition to *Spines* and *Visible Mending*, we have recently completed the integration of our EAD methods into an episode of the animated television series *Mami Fatale* as part of [Dr Monika Zabrocka](/monika-zabrocka-research)’s work on exploring different types of accessibility for young visually impaired audiences.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at enhancingad@gmail.com. Social media updates on the project are added on Twitter/X @Mariana_J_Lopez and on Bluesky @marianajlopez.bsky.social.

Thanks!

EAD team
