*Abstract:*

The ‘Enhancing Audio Description’ project investigates how digital audio technologies can transform the design and implementation of Audio Description for film, television and interactive media and as a result, change the ways in which visually impaired audiences experience audio-visual presentations. Mariana discussed and demonstrate an array of novel sound design techniques being used to enhance Audio Description, providing an audio track that is closer to the filmmaker’s vision and that aims to bridge the gap between sighted and visually impaired audiences.
