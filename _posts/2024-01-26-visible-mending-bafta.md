We are excited to announce that Visible Mending, a project we hold close to our hearts, has been nominated for the Best British Animated Short at the [British Academy Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards](https://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/2024-ee-bafta-film-awards-nominations-announced).

Visible Mending was mixed at the School of Arts and Creative Technologies last summer by Mariana. In addition to this our EAD team worked on the creation of an accessible version of the film in close collaboration with the creative team, including director Samantha Moore and producer Tilley Bancroft, etc.

The short film can be played with the embedded video player below.
