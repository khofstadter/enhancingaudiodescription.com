This presentation will introduce attendees to the concept of Enhanced Audio Description (EAD) and its application to film and television productions. EAD is an alternative to traditional Audio Description (AD) which offers a new paradigm for accessibility to film and television for visually impaired audiences, one in which the omnipresence of the voice is questioned in favour of the use of sound design for accessibility. The research team will explain how EAD combines sound effects, spatialisation and first person narration/description to produce accessible experiences that are a result of a close collaboration with creative teams.

Throughout the presentation the research team will be discussing their latest work, including an insight on how they worked on different fiction and non-fiction projects to make them accessible, as well as in live action and animation projects.
