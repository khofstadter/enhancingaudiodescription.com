          I am incredibly excited to be a part of this important work in the enhancement of audio description for film and television. Creating a soundtrack to support the storytelling in film is the core purpose of our work in sound post production. Sound has the ability to create images in the mind’s eye and trigger emotional responses, creating an immersive experience for the audience. I look forward to challenging my own thought processes in the creation of film sound and exploring technological opportunities to provide an enhanced experience for all filmgoers.
