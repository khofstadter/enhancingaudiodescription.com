          <p>My name is Chaimae Alouan. I graduated from the Higher Institute of Audiovisual and Film Professions (ISMAC) in Morocco with a bachelor's degree in film studies and audiovisual industry. Following this, in 2021 I graduated with a master's degree in sound engineering from the Superior School of Visual Arts Marrakech (ESAV Marrakech). I’m currently a PhD candidate at the University of York. I started my research under the theme “Cinema for visually impaired audiences: using sound perception to create new accessibility formats”. I worked as a freelancer in the audio field as a sound recordist and audio editor. I have four years of experience as a replay operator in the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football games with <a href="https://www.mediapro.tv/en/">Mediapro</a> in Morocco for national and international competitions. The most recent competition was the "2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations".
          <br><br>
          My role as Project Officer encompasses the management of the financial and administrative processes and procedures underpinning the project, as well as the planning of future project conferences, workshops and events.
