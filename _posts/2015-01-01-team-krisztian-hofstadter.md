Krisztián is a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer and artist. Besides working on the Enhancing Audio Description project as a research assistant, his doctoral research developed brain-computer music interfaces for meditation, in which neurofeedback is linked to auditory entrainment in generative soundscapes inspired by shamanic journeying. 


He has also been teaching music technology-related subjects (e.g. sonic art, sensor technology and music for the moving image) as an associate lecturer at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge and the University of Bedfordshire and currently teaches a module on sensemaking, digital identities and web-design at the School of Philosophy and Arts History at the University of Essex. As a freelancer and artist, he has been producing sound design and music, websites and visual art, including photography and paintings.
