## Internship 3
We are seeking an intern to investigate specific case studies of pre-existing sound design strategies utilised in audio games, headphone theatre productions, radio plays and podcasts, as well as other creative experiences. Specifically your work will involve:

- selection of a number of case studies, which should include work from artists and creatives from different ethnicities.
- close text analysis of the case studies, for example through watching theatre productions, listening to podcasts, playing games and recording gameplay etc.
- creating reports on the case studies, focusing on their use of sound and how said findings might feed into work on accessibility.
- communication of findings in meetings with the research team.

Closing Date : **26th June**
