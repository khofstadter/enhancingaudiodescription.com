To create an environment with considerable emphasis on equality, diversity, and inclusion, in early 2022, the University of York started a series of eight [Transformational Initiatives](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/mission-strategies/vision-for-york/transformational-initiatives/). One, the [Diverse Staff and Student Community](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/mission-strategies/vision-for-york/transformational-initiatives/diverse-staff-student-community/) initiative, focuses on establishing the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Exchange programme to help raise awareness of its values within the organisation and with external partners and stakeholders. To recognise initial and established individual or collective EDI efforts, the programme set up six categories for its 2022 Inclusive Impact Awards. The Enhancing Audio Description project was nominated under the Inclusive Research category. We are really grateful for this nomination for our work on more inclusive practices within the film and television industries!
