## Subtitle line length

- No more than 2 lines per subtitle. If possible the bottom line should be longer so as to not interfere with the image.

- Text should usually be kept to one line, unless it exceeds the character limitation. Follow these basic principles when the text has to be broken into 2 lines:

The line should be broken
- after punctuation marks
- before conjunctions
- before prepositions

The line break should not separate
- a noun from an article
- a noun from an adjective
- a first name from a last name
- a verb from a subject pronoun
- a prepositional verb from its preposition
- a verb from an auxiliary, reflexive pronoun or negation

- When necessary to edit dialogue to fit on screen within a set time, text must be coherent. For example: Remove unnecessary words such as: really, just, perhaps, that, quite, who, was, and which. 

- Maximum character per line is 42. 


## Translate the whole idea

- Each subtitle should be syntactically self-contained. Keep pronouns and verbs together. For example: 

```
It's actually quiet calm.
Look at the clouds.
```

- Names, off-screen interjections etc., should also be subtitled.

## Duration

- Subtitles should be visible for at least 1 second.

- Subtitles follow the rhythm of speech, matching the soundtrack. This helps people who lipread.

- Split subtitles lasting more than 7 seconds. Subtitles are more easily read if they stay within the shot.

## Maximum timing offset

- Subtitles shouldn't start more than 0.5 seconds before or after the audio begins.

## Sounds and Music

- Describe meaningful sounds that are relevant to the plot/subject. Sound-effect labels should be as brief as possible and should have the following structure: subject + active, finite verb. For example: 

`FLOORBOARDS CREAK` and not `CREAKING OF FLOORBOARDS`

- Sound effects are notated in all CAPS inside square brackets, in the present tense, inside the world of the play / video. For example `[ DOOR BELL RINGS ]`. 

- Onomatopoeia example: `grrrrrrrrrrr`.

- SFX description example: `[ AUDIENCE LAUGHTER ]`.

- Audience noise should be specified, with round brackets: `( AUDIENCE LAUGHTER )`.

- Describe relevant music which does not have lyrics, in Capital letters with a musical note(♪) or octothorpe (#). For example: `[ ♪ BLUES HARMONICA ♪ ]`.

- Where the name and artist are known include both, title of the piece followed by author or performer. Example: `[ ♪ FIFTH SYMPHONY - BEETHOVEN ♪]`.

- Wrap relevant lyrics in musical notes. The musical notes (♪) identify when the singing starts and ends. Example: `♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪`.

- For emphasis, avoid capital letters, use italics instead. Example: `I *will* not leave!`

- Vocal effect description should be factual rather than interpretive. In all caps inside brackets. Example: `[ WHISPER ]: But I love you!`. 

- Use a question and exclamation marks in brackets. Examples: `You're not going to work today, are you (?)` or `Charming(!)`.

- Give a flavour of the accents, where possible rather than every word spelled phonetically. Example: `[ FRENCH ACCENT ] M'sieur, don't mock me.`

- Off-screen voices, indicated by either a label or single quote or combination of the two. Example: `ATTENBROUGH: 'The pelican swoops'`

- Three dots (…) show a pause in speech / sound. Example: `The painting was … beautiful!`

- Attempt to give the meter of speech, repeating letters where necessary. Example: `I'm g-g-going home` or  `W-W-What are you doing?`

- Strong language should not be edited unless it is also bleeped out for hearing audience. Example: `What the F...(BLEEP) do you think you are doing.`

- Each speaker should have one line when they are together on one screen, and each lines should have a hyphen (-). For example: 

```
MILES: - Is there no remedy?
NINA: - None, but such remedy as...
```

- Use meaningful speech. Exclude things like “um” “ah” and other disfluencies.

- If a piece of speech is impossible to make out, if it's difficult speech, then label factually. Avoid subjective labels such as uninitelligible, imcomprehensible, or he babbles. Factual examples: `[ DRUNKEN SPEECH ]` or `[ SLURRED SPEECH ]`.

- If the audio is inaudible, clarify in bracket. Example: `[INAUDIBLE]`.

- Foreign languages should be written verbatim, written phonetically. Examples: `Thank you for having us, namaste.`

## Numbers
- Numbers between one and nine should be written in words. Example: `Five people waited outside.`
- Information normally as figures such as telephone numbers, house numbers should be retained as figures. Examples: `07707075721` or 23 Sandpiper Close
- A time is written in standard form. The passing of time is written in words. Example: `12:45 am. 3:00. Seven Minutes, twenty-three years, twelve days.`
- Money can vary depending on space. Example: `Fifty pence. £300. Twenty-three pounds. £18.36`
